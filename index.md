## WORK IN PROGRESS
Both me and this document

## Values

I value honesty and direct communication. I like requests that are clear and explicit and I try to make mine so. If I'm ever unclear or unspecific with my asks please call me out on it.


## Personality

**Quiet** I am shy by nature and will often stay quiet in meetings. I try to only talk when I have something to say. I don't always succeed at that goal.

**Honest** I will always answer a direct question honestly and directly. I try and make sure all of my communications are clear and try to avoid coded messages or making people guess what I need.

**Laid Back** I'm pretty relaxed about most things. Life is too short to freak out and things usually get worse when you do. That doesn't mean that I don't care and am not passionate about getting the right product launched in a timely fashion. I just don't believe that panic speeds things up.

**"Funny"** I try to be funny. It doesn't always work. If something I say doesn't land or crosses a line feel free to call me out on it. If you just don't find me funny then don't laugh. I'll eventually figure it out.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

I like to receive feedback directly and clearly. I don't care much about public recognition, awards or kudos. I would much rather hear directly from you how you feel and if there is anything you would like me to do differently.

## Work Patterns

I live in Minnesota in the US-Central timezone. That is +2 hours from Pacific time.

I usually work from ~8am-6pm Central (6am-4pm Pacific). I can work outside of those hours with some notice.

I often Slack out of hours but not always. If it is urgent I'm usually available and am on PagerDuty if I am not responding to Slack. My cell phone number is on my Slack profile and in Paylocity. Feel free to use it if you need to.

## Communication Preferences

Slack is my preferred method of communication. Slack me any time of day and I will respond as soon as I can. Don't be afraid to ping me if it seems like I'm ignoring you.

Email is my least preferred method and if you need a timely response to an email you should ping me on slack to let me know to look for it amongst the hundreds of emails I get every day.

I do not usually need a lot of heads-down time and spend most of my days in meetings. I will block my calendar if I need that time. Feel free to book any open spot on my calendar.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

I will tell you.

### Warning Signs

It can be hard to tell the difference between brooding and my standard resting grumpy face. I will usually try to be explicit about how I feel rather than leaning on people to recognize my tells. Sometimes it takes a minute for me to recognize my mood and needs but once I do I will try to be as honest about it as possible.

### How to help

Sometimes giving me a little time can help me figure out what I'm feeling and what I need. In general I will be responsible for my own needs and will communicate them to others as clearly as possible. You should not need to guess how you can help me.

## Me Being Me

My quietness can easily be mistaken for aggression or anger. Many people think I don't like them when I first meet them because I don't talk much around new people. I like most people so it's probably not the case for you. Probably.

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

**Passive aggression.** If you want something please say so. If you don't like something let me know. I'm pretty good at avoiding conflict but bad at picking up indirect signals.

**Unnecessary DMs.** Unless the matter is private, I think asking questions in open Slack channels is way more effective. Other people might have better answers than I or might benefit from sitting in on the conversation. You can ping me in the channel that is relevant to the topic at hand or in #customer-experience-engineering.


## Career Goals & Future Interests

My goal is to have the most impact for the company I'm working for. Right now that impact is expressed by managing others and helping them achieve the team goals. My long term goals are to grow that influence across a broader scope. That likely means expanding my team and growing it's mandate.


## Areas for Development

I am more reactive than proactive which can mean things slip through the cracks or have to be caught by somebody else. My EQ is not naturally very high so I have worked to compensate for that by learning communication skills and practicing empathy. I have trouble with details sometimes. Time management.
